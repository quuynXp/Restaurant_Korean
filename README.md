üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Management System - Backend Microservices
- A complete backend system for restaurant operations, built with Spring Boot microservices, containerized using Docker, and orchestrated via Eureka Service Discovery. Designed for scalability, performance, and real-time customer interaction.

üß© Microservices Overview
- Service	Description
    - Eureka-Server	
        Acts as a Service Discovery for registering all microservices. Enables dynamic discovery and load balancing of services across the system.
    - Gateway-Service	
        The API Gateway (Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway) handles routing, rate limiting, authentication (JWT), and forwards requests to appropriate backend services.
    - User-Service	
        Manages user registration, login, password reset, and role-based access control (admin/user). Implements JWT Auth (Access & Refresh Token), integrated with Spring Security + OAuth2.
    - Menu-Service	
        Provides CRUD APIs for managing menu items such as dishes, drinks. Supports full-text search using Elasticsearch.
    - Order-Service	
        Handles the entire order lifecycle. Supports placing, updating, tracking, and cancelling orders. Communicates with Kitchen, Payment, and Notification services.
    - Kitchen-Service	
        Receives and processes orders from Order-Service. Manages kitchen workflow and updates status in real time. Communicates status back to Order-Service or via Kafka.
    - Payment-Service	
        Integrates VNPAY QR and PayPal (Sandbox) for secure online payments. Validates payment status and triggers notifications or invoice generation.
    - Chat-Service	
        Real-time chat system built with Socket.IO, allowing communication between customers and restaurant staff for support or order-related queries.
    - Notification-Service	
        Sends real-time notifications via Kafka events, email (SMTP), or system messages when orders are created, updated, or payment is successful.
    - Invoice-Service	
        Generates downloadable invoices based on completed orders. Works closely with Payment-Service and sends invoices via email.
    - Report-Service	
        Generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports on revenue, order count, dish popularity, etc. Aggregates data from Order and Menu services.
    - Kitchen-Service	
        Manages backend kitchen operations, order queues, and preparation status.
    - Chatbot (part of User or standalone)	
        AI-based chatbot (OpenAI or similar) that assists users in booking tables, suggesting dishes, and handling basic inquiries.
    - docker-compose.yml	
        Container orchestration for all microservices, including MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and each Spring Boot service.
